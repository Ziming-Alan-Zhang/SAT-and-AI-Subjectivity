# SAT-and-AI-Subjectivity
What is SAT, what is sentence-transformers, and is AI better to do humanities or science? You will find answer here.
SAT, known as Scholastic Assessment Test, is not an English test. The predecessor of SAT is used to test soldiers' IQ during World War One. Hence, SAT is actually a logic test, comparable to the IQ tests you do these days. If SAT is a logic test, given this premise, a purely objective approach should be really effective.


I'm a high-school student, you can call me Alan, or you can call me Ziming. I think if you click into this page, you are also interested in logic and ethical problems about AI, right?


With the development of AI, people gradually rely on it. Then, an interesting question should be asked: is AI subjective, meaning they have characteristics and emotion, and they are able to control themselves, or is AI objective, which means it is purely based on the grand data base, and is controlled by its programs.


To endeaver deeper into our topic, I decided to investigate how exactly AI, or sentence-transformers, approach to SAT problems. Next, I will introduce thousands of SAT problems, in order to quantify my result. Then, I will change different sentence-transformer models, test broadly whether AI is subjective or objective. Finally, I will draw conclusion to whether AI behaves better in humanities or science.
